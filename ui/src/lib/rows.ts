// is the part that does not scale. Measured on the built SPA in Playwright's WebKitGTK, a playlist
// page with covers, scrolled end to end:

//     rows rendered      DOM nodes      web process
//        60                 1,512          340 MiB
//      1,000                23,132         488 MiB

//
// About 165 KB per rendered row past a thousand, and none of it the images (the same 1000-row list
// with no images at all measured the same). A Liked Songs list is routinely five figures.
//
// So: render the slice around the viewport, and stand in for the rest with a padded box, which
// keeps the scrollbar honest without keeping the rows. The maths is pure and lives here; the
// caller owns the two numbers that come from the DOM.
