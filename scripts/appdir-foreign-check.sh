#
# Also runs against a published release: extract it with `--appimage-extract` and mount
# squashfs-root instead. CI calls it for debian:sid and archlinux on every build.
#
# Three checks, in the order they catch things:
#
#   1. ldd -r on the app binary — every load-time symbol resolves. Catches KI-6, KI-7, KI-8.
#   2. Host libraries the app dlopens are still loadable with the AppDir on the search path.
#      An AppDir is first on LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so anything the host dlopens later (Mesa's EGL
#      vendor, gio modules, pixbuf loaders, IM modules) links against *our* copies of the shared
#      sonames. If ours are older than what the host's copy needs, it fails to load and the caller
#      usually reports something unrelated-looking. That is KI-9, and ldd -r cannot see it.
#   3. An actual launch under Xvfb. The verification hole behind four broken releases in one night
#      was that nothing ever started the app anywhere except the build host's own OS family.
