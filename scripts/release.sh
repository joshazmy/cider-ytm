# Cut a signed release: publish the tag with an empty updater manifest, start both CI builds, build
# the .rpm locally while they run, then wait and verify the whole thing landed.
#
# ORDER MATTERS. The release is created and both workflows are dispatched BEFORE the local rpm
# build, not after: CI's ~13 minutes and this machine's ~5 minutes then overlap instead of queueing.
# The rpm is uploaded to the already-published release afterwards. The cost of that ordering is that
# a failed rpm build leaves a published release with no rpm on it, recoverable with one
# `gh release upload`, and the script tells you the exact command if it happens.
#
# The AppImage is NOT built here. An AppImage inherits its build host's glibc floor, and this
# machine is Fedora (newest glibc in existence) — one built here starts nowhere else. It is built by
# .github/workflows/linux-release.yml on a pinned older runner, which also attaches it, adds the
# linux-x86_64 entry to latest.json and marks the release "Latest". Windows does the same for its
# own entry. So this script publishes the release NOT-latest on purpose: until CI has attached the
# binaries, the updater endpoint (.../releases/latest/download/latest.json) keeps resolving to the
# previous, complete manifest instead of one with no platforms in it.
#
# Usage:  scripts/release.sh ["release notes"]
# Bump "version" in src-tauri/tauri.conf.json AND Cargo.toml BEFORE running (tauri.conf.json is the
# app version the updater compares against; the preflight below refuses to run if they disagree).
#
# Requires: the private signing key at ~/.tauri/yapel.key, `gh` authed, jq, curl.
