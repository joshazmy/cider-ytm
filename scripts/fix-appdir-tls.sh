# Repair the bundled AppDir so it runs on hosts that aren't the build machine, then repack and
# re-sign the AppImage in place.
#
# Four defects, all from linuxdeploy:
#
#   1. GIO_EXTRA_MODULES is written with a literal newline in it, plus an absolute path into the
#      build machine's own target/ directory. GLib parses one garbage path, finds no module, and
#      the webview falls back to GDummyTlsBackend (supports_tls=False): no HTTPS at all, so no
#      thumbnails, no player.js, no PoToken, and mpv gets handed a dead URL. Fixed by pointing it
#      at the AppDir's own module directories.
#
#   2. libjack.so.0 is on linuxdeploy's excludelist (it normally must match the host's JACK), but
#      libmpv.so.2 and libavdevice.so.60 DT_NEED it — so on a host with no JACK at all the app
#      cannot even start: "error while loading shared libraries: libjack.so.0". Fixed by bundling
#      it. That also makes the host's pipewire-jack shim unreachable, which is what killed v0.2.10:
#      the shim came from the host, wanted pw_log_topic_register from pipewire 1.6, and resolved
#      against the pipewire 1.0 in the bundle.
#
#   3. libwayland-client.so.0 gets bundled even though it is on the upstream AppImage excludelist,
#      and that one library breaks the app on every Mesa host (KI-9). Ubuntu 24.04 ships wayland
#      1.22; Mesa 25/26 as shipped by Debian testing, Arch and Fedora 44 needs wl_fixes_interface,
#      wl_display_create_queue_with_name and wl_display_dispatch_queue_timeout, all wayland >= 1.23.
#      The AppDir is first on LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so when the WebKit web process dlopens the host's
#      libEGL_mesa.so.0 it resolves against our 1.22 and fails on those three symbols. libglvnd then
#      has no vendor, eglGetDisplay returns EGL_NO_DISPLAY, and WebKit kills the process:
#      "Could not create default EGL display: EGL_BAD_PARAMETER. Aborting..." — once per webview,
#      so the window and both hidden webviews are dead and the app does nothing at all. Invisible on
#      NVIDIA, whose EGL vendor library does not use those symbols, which is why it survived every
#      test on the maintainer's desktop.
#
#   4. GLib scans its compiled-in module directory in addition to GIO_EXTRA_MODULES, and for an
#      Ubuntu build that is /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gio/modules — a path that also exists on the
#      user's Debian or Ubuntu host, holding modules built against their much newer GLib. It loads
#      them into our 2.80 and they fail. Fixed by also setting GIO_MODULE_DIR, which replaces the
#      compiled-in path rather than adding to it.
#
# ON PRUNING. v0.2.11 pruned eight libraries and broke worse than what it fixed, so the bar is high,
# but "never prune" is the wrong rule — defect 3 above is only fixable by pruning. What made v0.2.11
# wrong, and what a prune has to clear:
#
#   - Sonames must be portable. Arch ships libnettle.so.9; the bundle's libarchive and libsrt want
#     .so.8, so dropping it made the app unloadable there. libwayland-client.so.0 is .so.0 on every
#     distro and its ABI only ever gains symbols, so the host's copy always satisfies our 1.22 users.
#   - The host must be guaranteed to have it. GTK 3 and Mesa both hard-depend on libwayland-client,
#     so any host that can run a GUI has it. That is also why upstream lists it as a system library.
#   - It must not be a plugin directory. Host gio modules are built against the host's GLib; that
#     half of v0.2.11 is what produced the gvfs errors, and defect 4 is the last of it.
#
# The trust store that started all of this needs no help now: Ubuntu's gnutls has
# /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt compiled in, and that path exists on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and
# Arch alike (verified against the bundled stack in containers on each). Building on Fedora is what
# made the anchors unreachable, and the build moved to Ubuntu.
#
# Usage:  scripts/fix-appdir-tls.sh [bundle-dir]     (default: target/release/bundle/appimage)
# Runs from CI (.github/workflows/linux-release.yml) and by hand after a local
# `cargo tauri build --bundles appimage` when you want to test the repaired AppDir.
